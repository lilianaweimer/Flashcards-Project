# FlashCards

## Abstract

This was the first solo project of Mod 2 at the Turing School of Software & Design. The goal was to create a flashcards application that runs solely in the console, using test-driven development. Additional learning goals were learning to write Mocha/Chai tests, practicing test-driven development, and introducing ES6 into practice.
